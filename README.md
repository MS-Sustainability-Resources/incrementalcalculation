# Incremental Calculation
Microsoft Sustainability supports auto calculations for those activity records being imported using Power Query experience and if the calculation profiles are marked to auto-run as shown below

Customers also would like to run calculations automatically for below scenarios:

Scenario-1: Activity data is entered manually into system
Scenario-2: Activity data is imported using Excel/CSV files using PowerApps Import capabilities
Scenario-3: Data Approval Management is enabled for Activity data and calculation needs to be run when they are approved

This repository provides automation components to trigger calculations for these scenarios.
